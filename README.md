# The Beatles Project

Actually, this website has been created by me for quite some time, but I've only recently uploaded it here. This website is a simple one that contains information about The Beatles, including their songs, albums, galleries, and details about each band member. Additionally, on this website, users can create a list of their favorite Beatles songs.
